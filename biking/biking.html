<h2>What equipment do I need?</h2>
<p>Seems pretty obvious, but it’s astounding how many people actually ride trails without a helmet on, which is like begging for a brain injury.
  Don’t ride without a helmet.
You can get a pretty decent helmet for as little as $50 or up to $300 if you want to splurge.
If you’re in North America, try Mountain Equipment Co-op (Canada) or REI (USA), or if you're in Europe, Decathlon – they have great prices and selection.
When researching helmets, you may come across the abbreviation MIPS which stands for Multi-directional Impact Protection,
it's the newest design for mountain biking helmets that offer greater protection for rotational impact injuries which are common with biking.

The key is to get something that fits snugly and won’t wobble around while you’re riding (or crashing).
If you can’t make your helmet snug then it won’t protect your head.
Also try and get something that is well-ventilated so you don’t have rivers of sweat pouring into your eyes.
Costis is $50 - $200.

<dt>What kind of water supplies do I need.</dt>
<dd>Water bottles that atatch to a water bottle cage on your frame are the cheapest option,
  but they generally don’t carry enough water for a long-distance ride.
  If you’re planning on doing any rides that are more than 2 hours long you should invest in a hydration pack.
  We love Osprey Packs, they’re some of the best built and feature-rich packs on the market.
  Cost for water bottle and cage is $20.

<h2>What safety precautions should I take?</h2>
<p>Get some glasses with clear lenses (as opposed to sunglasses, which are not recommended if you’re riding in the forest).
  They’ll potentially save you from being blinded by a stick in the eye.
  A basic model will set you back $20, or if you want to splurge, get some with removable lenses in various colours for different lighting conditions.
  Cost is $20 - $200.</p>

<dt>What type of clothing do I need?</dt>
<dd>If you’ve ever wiped without gloves and landed on your hands, you’ll probably never ride again without gloves.
  Get the full-fingered kind - you’re not a bike courier. And get some with a bit of palm padding to cut down on hand fatigue.
  Cost is $20.
  A decent pair of riding shorts, with padding inside, will keep you from getting saddle sore and/or getting rashes in places where you don’t want rashes.
  Cost is $60.

<h2>Teams</h2>
<p>One member of the team serves as its leader, and the others do everything they can to help him win.
  In the major races, each team leader works with eight other riders, called “domestiques,” who don’t have much chance of winning the race themselves.
  Top teams typically have 20 or more cyclists on their rosters, from which team managers can choose a nine-person team suited for each event. <a href=""><cite></cite></a> published in 1887.</p>

<dt>Types of Bikes</dt>
<dd>Road bikes are also versatile: you can add clip-on aerobars and have some adjustments made to make your bike more aero.
  Triathlon bikes, with steeper angles and aerodynamic positioning, are built for speed and cutting through wind. You are more forward on the saddle,
  which can be tough to get used to for new riders. <span class="price">$6.95</span></dd>
